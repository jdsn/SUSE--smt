Migration between SCC and NCC
=============================

SMT can talk to one registration service only (SCC, NCC, or alternatively also SLMS). Migrating between the registration servers can be done either via the YaST smt-server module or via command-line tools.

Before migrating between customer centers, make sure that the target customer center can serve all products that are registered against SMT. Both YaST as well as the command-line scripts perform a check to find out whether all products can be served with the new registration server. If this is not possible the only option is to install an additional (parallel) SMT instance. One instance to synchronize the SCC products and the other one to synchronize the NCC products.

To perform the migration to SCC via the command-line tool, run:

  smt ncc-scc-migration

To get its parameters, see the --help output. If you need to revert back from SCC to NCC, run:

  smt scc-ncc-migration

The migration itself is time-consuming and during the migration process the SMT server may not be able to serve clients, which are already registered.

The migration process itself changes the registration server and the proper type of API in the configuraiton files. Users do not have to perform any other task to achieve the switch.

To migrate between NCC and SCC via YaST, use the YaST smt-server module.

After the migration is done, it is needed to synchronize SMT with the new registration server via 'smt-sync'.



Repository Structure
====================

The repository structure in the /srv/www/htdocs directory matches the structure as it comes from SCC. This directory structure differs from the structure coming from NCC. The following directories are available (selected examples, similar for other products and architectures):

repo/SUSE/Products/SLE-SDK/12/x86_64/product/

- the -POOL repository of SDK (the GA version of all packages)

repo/SUSE/Products/SLE-SDK/12/x86_64/product.license/

- EULA associated with the product

repo/SUSE/Updates/SLE-SDK/12/x86_64/update/
repo/SUSE/Updates/SLE-SDK/12/s390x/update/
repo/SUSE/Updates/SLE-SERVER/12/x86_64/update/

- Update repositories for respective products

repo/full/SUSE/Updates/SLE-SERVER/12/x86_64/update/
repo/testing/SUSE/Updates/SLE-SERVER/12/x86_64/update/

- Custom created repositories as well as repositories in the staging environment follow the same semantics as repositories coming from NCC.


Enabling SLP Announcements
==========================

SMT already includes the SLP service description file (/etc/slp.reg.d/smt.reg). In order to enable SLP announcements of the SMT service, open respective ports in the firewall and enable the SLP service:

  sysconf_addword /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2 FW_SERVICES_EXT_TCP "427"
  sysconf_addword /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2 FW_SERVICES_EXT_UDP "427"
  insserv slpd
  rcslpd start
